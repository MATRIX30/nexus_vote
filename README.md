# Description
Nexus vote is a decentralized secure and transparent platform that enables users to rapidly create dynamic and transparent polls to get the democratic pulse of their Electorates on an opinion. This application uses a MFA mechanism to authenticate its users and a transparent dashboard to view in real time the computation of the results of a Poll. It also provides a custom authentication algorithm to prevent fraud in voting such as double voting the system uses unique generated Keys for each voter which once used canâ€™t be used again, vote tempering the integrity of polls is guaranteed by hashing and signature to capture snapshots of states of a poll and preserve its integrity.
